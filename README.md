The Book Engine application utilizes GraphQL via an Apollo server, React, a MongoDB database, and node.js. To run the application, "npm install" needs to 
be conducted at the root, server, and client levels, and "npm start" can then be run from the client directory. From there, users can find books titles via
the set API, login, and add and delete books from their account. The deployed application can be found at https://git.heroku.com/lit-eyrie-42855.git
